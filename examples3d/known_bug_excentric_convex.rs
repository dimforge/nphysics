 * # Expected behaviour:
 * Same as the box_vee3d demo.
 *
 * It seems to behave as expected if the excentricity is not too big (tested with 10 and 100).
 *
 * # Symptoms:
 * Some object just fall through the ground, missing any collison. Then, after a while they seem
 * to notice that they are deep into the plane, and "jump" due to penetration resolution.
 * Thus, some collision are missed.
 * Identically, some boxes just dont collide to each other some times.
 *
 * # Cause:
 * Not sure, but this seems to be an accuracy limitation of the contact manifold generators
 * (OneShotContactManifoldGenerator and IncrementalContactManifoldGenerator). The repetitive
 * transformations of the saved contact might invalidate them.
 *
 * However, this might be a real bug for some other non-accuracy-related reasons. For example, when
 * a box is deep on the plane without contact why does the one-shot contact manifold generator
 * fails? Something wrong with the perturbation?
 *
 * This might be (but it is very unlikely) a problem with the DBVT that might become invalid.
 * Though this seems very unlikely as the AABBs seem to be fine and the plane has an infinite aabb
 * anyway. Thurthermore, the ray-cast (which uses the dbvtâ€¦) works fine, even for "jumpy" objects.
