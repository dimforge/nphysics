========
**nphysics** is a 2 and 3-dimensional physics engine for games and animations.
It uses [ncollide](http://ncollide.org) for collision detection, and
[nalgebra](http://nalgebra.org) for vector/matrix math. 2D and 3D
implementations both share the same code!


Examples are available in the `examples2d` and `examples3d` directories. There
is also a short (outdated) [demonstration video](http://youtu.be/CANjXZ5rocI).
An on-line version of this documentation is available
[here](http://nphysics.org). Feel free to ask for help and discuss features on
the official [user forum](http://users.nphysics.org).

## Why another physics engine?
There are a lot of physics engine out there.
However having a physics engine written in Rust is much more fun than
writing bindings and has several advantages:

- it shows that Rust is suitable for soft real-time applications
- it shows how well Rust behaves with highly generic code
- it shows that there is no need to write two separate engine for 2D and 3D:
  genericity wrt the dimension is possible (modulo low level arithmetic
  specializations for each dimension).
- in a not-that-near future, C++ will die of ugliness. Then, people will
  search for a physics engine and **nphysics** will be there, proudly
  exhibiting its _Rusty_ sexyness.

## Compilation
You will need the latest release of the [Rust compiler](http://www.rust-lang.org)
and the official package manager: [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

If you want to use the 2D version of `nphysics`, add the crate named
`nphysics2d` to your dependencies:

```ignore
[dependencies]
nphysics2d = "0.9"
```

For the 3D version, add the crate named `nphysics3d`:

```ignore
[dependencies]
nphysics3d = "0.9"
```

Use `make examples` to build the demos and execute `./your_favorite_example_here --help`
to see all the cool stuffs you can do.

## Features
- Static and dynamic rigid bodies.
- Common convex primitives: cone, box, ball, cylinder.
- Concave geometries build from convex primitives (aka. compound geometries).
- Stable stacking.
- Island based sleeping (objects deactivation).
- Ray casting.
- Swept sphere based continuous collision detection.
- Ball-in-socket joint.
- FixedJoint joint.
- Sensors.

## What is missing?
**nphysics** is a very young library and needs to learn a lot of things to
become a grown up. Many missing features are because of missing features on
**ncollide**. Features missing from **nphysics** itself include:

- efficient signaling system
- more joints, joint limits, joint motors and breakable joints.
- soft-bodies (see https://github.com/natal/roft for a draft)
- parallel pipeline
- GPU-based pipeline

## Dependencies
All dependencies are automatically cloned with a recursive clone.
The libraries needed to compile the physics engine are:

* [ncollide](http://ncollide.org): the collision detection library.
* [nalgebra](http://nalgebra.org): the linear algebra library.

The libraries needed to compile the examples are:
