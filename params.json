There is also a short\r\n(outdated) demonstration video [there](http://youtu.be/CANjXZ5rocI). Feel free to ask for help and discuss features on the official [users forum](http://users.nphysics.org).  \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Static and dynamic rigid bodies.\r\n- Common convex primitives: cone, box, ball, cylinder.\r\n- Concave geometries build from convex primitives.\r\n- Stable stacking.\r\n- Island based sleeping (objects deactivation).\r\n- Ray casting.\r\n- Swept sphere based continuous collision detection.\r\n- Ball-in-socket joint.\r\n- Fixed joint.\r\n\r\nFor more, check out the documentations of the two variants of the library:\r\n* [nphysics2d](doc/nphysics2d), for the 2d physics engine using 32-bit floats.\r\n* [nphysics3d](doc/nphysics3d), for the 3d physics engine using 32-bit floats.\r\n\r\nDouble-precision floating point numbers may be enabled using the `f64` feature.",
